## Mech Interp 
1. Can you unembed from any point in the model?
    - I think not because the dimensions are not constant 
    - but would it work for any point in the resid stream
2. How do we measure if a feature is monosemantic? 
3. What if I use SAE activations for the steering vectors I am trying to transfer from one model to another? Like this [tutorial](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/using_an_sae_as_a_steering_vector.ipynb)
