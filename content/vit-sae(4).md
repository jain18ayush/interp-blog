## Work Done
- Loaded in data by label for the dsprites data 
- attempted to start linear probe training 
- looked at [refactoring + design pattern](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-some-good-channels-li-dyJf2sSIQa6ydXemcGxAbQ) stuff 

## Confusions
- should I train on mlp or logistic regression? 
    - does it matter? 

## Next Steps
- have a pipeline up and running to train a probe on the embeddings
- create a pipeline do finally dev interp this 
- maybe play with subspaces?
