## Work Done
- Determined a way to measure feature granularity / overlap as we go down 
- Separated and cleaned up embedding generation 
- [Claude Project Feature Granularity](https://claude.ai/chat/7d3decb5-3b65-4427-8835-ecebffda3416)

## Confusions
- What does each metric I made mean? 
- Do they actually measure how broad each concept becomes 

## Next Steps
- Find the most similar vectors from one layer to the other and see what happens when you apply them?? 

- Separate out results as well because some datasets are overpowering others. 
- Analyze results and see if I can come to a conclusion 
- If so then try to invalidate those results 
- Try other methods of validation as well
