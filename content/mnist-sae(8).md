Title: MNIST-SAE Log 8
Date: 11/03/2024 00:32
Category: Experiment Logs

## Work Done
- Loaded in EMNIST dataset and ran an SAE + meta-sae on it. 

## Confusions
- how do I measure the impact of continuous meta-saes? 
    - run MNIST dataset and see if there are more distinct pattenrs that emerge over time 

## Next Steps
- Graph the activation distribution for the sae vs the meta-sae 
    - this claude chat has some of the [code](https://claude.ai/chat/925ecbb6-227c-4d90-8f35-609ba2d310dc)
- __Look at the work of the [meta-sae paper](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/TMAmHh4DdMr4nCSr5/showing-sae-latents-are-not-atomic-using-meta-saes)__
    - distill it down into notes and replicate its experiments 
- Deploy the site at some point
